# Chore Sync

Chore Sync is a work-in-progress mobile application designed to help you synchronize and manage home-related tasks with your chosen group, such as family, friends, or roommates. With Chore Sync, you can easily collaborate on chores, shopping lists, and notes, ensuring everyone stays on the same page.

## Features

- **Chore Management**: Add, update, and track household chores with your group.
- **Shopping List**: Create and share shopping lists to ensure nothing is forgotten.
- **Notes**: Share important notes or reminders with your group.

## Current Status
